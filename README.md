🏡 House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses a machine learning model to predict the price of a house based on features like its size (area), number of bedrooms and bathrooms,guest room, parking space, and more. The model is built using Python and deployed with Streamlit for easy web-based access.

📌 Objectives
Use historical housing data to build a regression model.

Train the model to predict house prices based on multiple input features.

Build an interactive web app using Streamlit so users can input data and get predicted prices in real time.

🧠 What the Model Considers
The model uses the following inputs to make predictions:

Area (in square feet)

Number of Bedrooms

Number of Bathrooms

Number of Stories (Floors)

Main Road Access (yes/no)

Guest Room (yes/no)

Basement (yes/no)

Hot Water Heating (yes/no)

Air Conditioning (yes/no)

Parking Spaces

Preferred Area (yes/no)

Furnishing Status (furnished / semi-furnished / unfurnished)

⚙ Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Joblib (for saving the model)

Streamlit (for building the web app).
